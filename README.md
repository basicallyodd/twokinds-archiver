# TwoKinds Archive Backup Creator


A Python script to download all pages of TwoKinds to date. 

## Motivation
I wanted to read Tom Fischbach's comic TwoKinds while offline.  


## Prerequisites

Python dependencies: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the script
```bash
python 2kinds.py
```


## Next Steps
These are items I thought of, but didn't do yet:
- ~~Don't re-download pages that are already downloaded~~
    - ~~this way, the tool can be run on a schedule to maintain an offline backup of the comic~~
- Combine downloaded images into PDF upon run
